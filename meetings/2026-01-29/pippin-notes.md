# Design Conversations 2026-01-29, Pippin's Notes

## Austin

- A machine appears on the table
- All our bodies have a resonance
- Working on exciting resonances within "metal bodies"
- "Post-schizophonic"
- A world where sound is separated from source (pathologized in that term)
- "Sound as computational material"
- Sound beyond the speaker(​🔥​ Where is the ear in this?)
- Speakers as high fidelity, kind of subservient to the sound? Austin wants something a bit more rowdy
- How does he decide what to do next?
  - Partly about what is exciting to do: sometimes that's a specific sound, sometimes that's soldering
- MDM
  - There is code involved, but that's not the only element
  - Commit when there's something "worth recording" -- I got a new sound out of it
  - Builds up a set of tasks, trying to be organized -- GANTTing (GNATTing)
- "Computational Composites" (Anna Somebody)
  - Getting away from "computation → screen", form follows function
  - You have computational material, a transducer/activator, expressional material
- "Speaking piano" gets referenced as aspirational
- What *counts* as exploring the computational material?
- "Having time to play with it is the biggest thing" that "yields the most new ideas"
  - Writing a journal entry which *includes* a recording of the session
- Journal entries, rough notes, tag for ideas, creating short essays, ...
  - Tagging as a kind of in-progress thematic analysis
- Sidebar into: classic commit lingo like "fix" "feat" and so on being useful when you're revisiting a repo because you can more quickly zero in on presumably significant moments
- "My dream is that the essay just happens"
- Top priority is a second string - hoping it will make it more recordable

## Vadim

- A *remake* of a game for the "game by its cover" game jam (:fire: Remakes as a potentially very interesting/provocative thing to think about through MDM?)
- People called the original an "alt game"
- Another game in the series for another game jam ← :fire: Game jams in relation to MDM and design practice?
- So this is technically the *third* entry in the series (as a remake of the first one), trying to make it *better* "then it kind of escalated and here we are"
- Realising he *needed* compute shaders in order to do what he wanted - specifically vegetation that would grow in real time (lots of)
- Keeping the elements of the original, but increase player agency; simple actions → complex outcomes; leading to ecosystem stuff (in part *because* of the compute shaders :fire:)
- the geysers, the haze, the wind, the bamboo/plants (ecosystem structuring)
- challenging the trope/idea of "perpetual growth" present in real life and in games
- The more you collect, the more the world undermines your intentions... bamboo grows and blocks the connection between "collectors" and the sun (causing trouble with resource collection)
- Moving toward: gameplay flips; instead of finding mining sites you want to optimize a smaller subset; strategic placement, maybe removing things that you had placed, ... (the idea of :fire: undoing play) ← with the idea of *surprise* as operative in this
- "You're *about* to collide with the bamboo"
- Relationships between the hard-core technical things (compute shaders, say) and the design stuff; 
- Enric brings up "min-maxing" in this system; you know what the system "should be" and are handling the variables; but then new variables show up *because* of your min-maxing (height of the bamboo say) [Vadim talks about the "dumbness" of the collector following as another version of this - that it would struggle with the bamboo as part of its navigation; brings it up by saying "no NavMesh" so again there's a kind of technical moment in there, a technical choice... - but the obsession with tech x design is probably more me than anything]
- Using the "normals" in the scanner thing, information the engine already has for you repurposed as a special kind of vision (also functions as a kind of night vision)
- "What do you want people to be doing at night?" (Austin)
- Trying to figure out balancing in the situation where the consequences of your actions are *delayed*; how many days would the player *need* to get to the "flip state"
  - Via Stephen: maybe the need is for more feedback, to make change more apparent
- "Plus maybe alien ruins at some point..."
- "I never want to use UI for anything"
